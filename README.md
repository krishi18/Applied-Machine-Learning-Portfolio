# Applied Machine Learning Portfolio 🚀

## Overview
Welcome to my portfolio of applied machine learning projects. This repository contains a collection of supervised learning implementations that demonstrate the end-to-end data science workflow—from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing to model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

The projects are categorized by learning objective: **Regression Analysis** (predicting continuous values) and **Classification** (predicting categorical classes).

## 📂 Project Directory

| Project Name | Type | Description | Key Techniques |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[01_Global_Wellbeing_Regression](./01_Global_Wellbeing_Regression)** | Regression | Predicting "Happiness Scores" and "Life Expectancy" based on socio-economic indicators (GDP, Social Support, Mortality). | • Polynomial Features<br>• Ridge/SGD Regressors<br>• Pipeline Construction |
| **[02_Material_Classification](./02_Material_Classification)** | Classification | Automated identification systems for Geological Rocks and Glass Types for forensic/industrial application. | • Support Vector Machines (SVM)<br>• Random Forests & Ensembles<br>• Handling Class Imbalance |

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:**
    * `Scikit-Learn`: Model building, pipelines, and preprocessing.
    * `Pandas` & `NumPy`: Data manipulation and vectorization.
    * `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: Data visualization and correlation heatmaps.
    * `SciPy`: Statistical analysis.

## 🧠 Key Competencies Demonstrated
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values (Imputation), outlier detection (IQR), and Feature Scaling (StandardScaler).
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.
* **Model Evaluation:** Using K-Fold Cross-Validation and metrics like RMSE (for Regression) and Accuracy/Confusion Matrices (for Classification).
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance using `GridSearchCV`.
